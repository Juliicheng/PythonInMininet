# PythonInMininet
Practise of python coding, working in Mininet enviornment

This very first practise of me will use mininet to creat a network with four full-meshed routers
and each one connected to one switch, each switch conneced with 2 hosts.

To controll this network, a built-in mininet controller will do the job. All routers will be configured manually at this stage.
